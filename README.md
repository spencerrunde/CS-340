# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To make my programs maintainable and adaptable, I always make sure that my code is modular. Modular programming makes it much easier to make changes to a program, as each function is contained within its own individual module. Making code readable involves using proper syntax and spacing, along with making use of plenty of comments to denote what specific lines of code do. One of the main advantages of working this way is that it is very easy to reuse modular code for multiple projects, which is what I did when working on the Grazioso Salvare project with my CRUD module. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I typically approach a problem by developing the programs required functionality one piece at a time. This allows me to test every functionality individually, and ensure that they are all working separately before I test the complete program. In the past I had worked on projects as a whole, and this led to a lot of wasted time as I ran tests and had to locate what was causing errors. Another strategy that I made heavy use of during this course was studying documentation and user guides for the libraries that I was employing. I will definitely do this with any new libraries that I use in the future.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists create programs and add new functionality to existing programs that enhance the end-users experience while using the program. This matters because of the way that these programs benefit people. For example, the dashboard created here for Grazioso Salvare is of great assistance when it comes to viewing the data given to them by the five animal shelters. Besides being much easier to view compared to looking at the format displayed in the .json file, the dashboard also offers Grazioso Salvare many filtering options, which make it easier to find exactly what they're looking for.
